We will write a web application named Learning Log, with which
the user will be able to keep a log of topics of interest to him and create
journal entries while studying each topic. The Learning Log home page
contains a description of the site and invites the user to register
or enter your credentials. After successful login,
the user has the opportunity to create new topics, add new entries, read
and edit existing entries
